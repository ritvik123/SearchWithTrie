REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo\nSince 1998, World Trade Organization (WTO) members have renewed a ban on import duties on so-called \xe2\x80\x9celectronic\ntransmissions\xe2\x80\x9d, worth up to $255 billion a year by one estimate.\nSome think this favors rich countries, given it received strong backing from Washington at the outset and most of the lost customs revenues are thought to be born by developing countries.\nPressure is now growing to lift the ban as more books and movies become digital, potentially reducing revenues further.\nIndia and South Africa circulated an internal WTO document, reviewed by Reuters this week, saying that rising digitalization compelled \xe2\x80\x9ca rethink of the role of the temporary moratorium\xe2\x80\x9d last year, citing the potential of 3D printing to manufacture products. It will be decided on next week and renewal requires full consensus.\nAsked about its position, South Africa\xe2\x80\x99s WTO Ambassador Xolelwa Mlumbi-Peter said in an emailed response this week that it was \xe2\x80\x9cstill consulting on this important decision.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIndia did not respond to a request for comment.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt the moment there are a number of countries that feel confident they can stand aside from the global consensus,\xe2\x80\x9d said the International Chamber of Commerce\xe2\x80\x99s (ICC) Secretary General John Denton. \xe2\x80\x9cIt could break the Internet.\xe2\x80\x9d\nA proposal backed by 21 countries including China and Canada seeks to extend the ban for at least six months when it expires at year end. Deal-broker Switzerland said \xe2\x80\x9ca large part of the WTO has signaled its support for the Moratorium\xe2\x80\x9d.\nSuch duties could be difficult to apply and it is not clear how it would be determined where the digital product originate from and whether it is an import.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHow do you put a tariff on a byte? How would you capture millions of data flows from multiple sources flowing across countries\xe2\x80\x99 borders every minute of every day,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Denton.\nHowever, the first possible answers are emerging. Indonesia created tariff codes for digital goods in 2018, fixing the level at 0 percent for now.\nLOST REVENUES?\nShould the moratorium end, it does not mean that tariffs will immediately follow, and Mlumbi-Peter stressed that. But this is seen as more likely in a new culture of permissiveness\nfollowing the expected paralysis of the WTO\xe2\x80\x99s top ruling body after Dec. 10.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf someone tries to experiment putting customs duties on even a limited set of products or services, then there is a risk of immediate retaliation absent of the dispute settlement\nfunction,\xe2\x80\x9d said the ICC\xe2\x80\x99s Andrew Wilson.\nFILE PHOTO: A boy tries to use an Apple laptop at a computer shop in Tokyo, Japan, May 10, 2019.

At the top of the scale, a recent U.N. report said potential annual tariff revenue losses could be up to $10.4 billion a year, with more than $10 billion lost by WTO developing countries.\n\xe2\x80\x9cMore and more production is going to be digitized in future so developing countries will lose tariff revenues,\xe2\x80\x9d Rashmi Banga, the report\xe2\x80\x99s author, said.\nHowever, an OECD study questioned these assumptions, arguing that the revenue gains from lifting the ban would be relatively small and tariffs would lead to higher prices for consumers among other costs.\nReporting by Emma Farge; Editing by Toby Chopra\n'
