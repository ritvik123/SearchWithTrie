REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo\nThe four regional Fed bank presidents gaining a vote on interest rates starting in January are slightly less hawkish overall than the four they replace, a review of public comments and voting records shows.\nFed Chair Jerome Powell has said that after three rate cuts this year, only a \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial\xe2\x80\x9d change to the economic outlook could trigger a further reduction. When they meet next week for the last time this year, policymakers are expected to leave rates in the current range of 1.5% to 1.75%.\nNext year will be a different story, says Oxford Economics\xe2\x80\x99 Gregory Daco, who expects a cooling economy, sub-2% inflation and persistent trade tensions to force a reassessment of the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s outlook in the early part of the year. Also making a rate cut more likely, he said, is that starting in January, rate-setters will be a \xe2\x80\x9cslightly more dovish group that is likely to favor more easing in the event of a deteriorating outlook.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTo be sure, Daco and others said, the voting lineup is far from determinative.\nAll 17 Fed policymakers participate in two days of discussions that precede each final rate-setting vote by 10 of them, and non-voters can exert considerable influence during that time. Partly because voters do rotate every January, policymakers tend to favor compromise and consensus.\n(For a graphic on Fed policymakers' voting records, views and take on the economy, please see tmsnrt.rs/38ctFOI )\nHAWKS AND DOVES\nEven among voters, the differences are subtle.\nBoth hawkish dissenters against this year\xe2\x80\x99s three interest rate cuts - Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren and Kansas City Fed President Esther George - rotate out of the voting lineup after next week\xe2\x80\x99s meeting.\nChicago Fed President Evans, who supported the rate cuts, also drops off the voting roll, as does St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, who used his vote in 2019 to signal support for even steeper rate cuts than the Fed delivered.\nRotating in are Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, who  opposed all three rate cuts, and Philadelphia Fed President Harker, who went along with the first rate cut but opposed the other two. Joining them will be Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, who backed the 2019 rate cuts, though in October it was on condition the Fed made it clear no more were likely unless conditions worsen.\nThe fourth new 2020 voter, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, is arguably the most dovish among all Fed policymakers. Like Bullard, he wanted a bigger rate cut than his colleagues in 2019, but he also proposed the Fed promise not to raise rates until inflation reaches 2% on a sustained basis.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn net, the committee will be slightly less hawkish,\xe2\x80\x9d said Michael Brown, principal U.S. economist for Visa, meaning voters could be more open to rate cuts than otherwise.\nBut, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not sure it matters much,\xe2\x80\x9d because Fed policymakers will, in the end, react to economic data.\nConsumer spending bolstered by strong jobs growth has propelled the U.S. economy despite a decline in business spending and a drop in manufacturing output as the U.S.-China trade war continues.\nShould that pillar of growth show signs of weakening, Brown said, Fed voters won\xe2\x80\x99t be the only ones on board with easing.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think you would get a broad consensus to cut rates as needed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nReporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Dan Grebler\n"
