REUTERS/David McNew\nThe three-man, five-woman U.S. District Court jury will likely get the case before noon on Friday, after a federal judge instructs them on the law and attorneys for both men deliver closing statements.\nThe jurors will be asked to decide by unanimous vote if Musk, 48, defamed Vernon Unsworth with three July 15, 2018 tweets, and if so how much he must pay in damages.\nLegal experts are closely watching the proceedings, which is believed to be the first major defamation lawsuit brought by a private individual to go to trial over a tweet.\nUnsworth, 64, on Thursday declined to apologize for a July 13, 2018, CNN interview in which he said Musk\xe2\x80\x99s offer of a mini-submarine to help rescue a boys\xe2\x80\x99 soccer team from a flooded Thailand cave was a \xe2\x80\x9cPR stunt\xe2\x80\x9d and the wealthy entrepreneur could \xe2\x80\x9cstick his submarine where it hurts.\xe2\x80\x9d\nUnsworth said his insult was \xe2\x80\x9cnot to Mr Musk personally\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how I need to apologize. It was my opinion at the time and I stand by that opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when cross-examined by one of Musk\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers.\nIt was that interview which Musk has said prompted his \xe2\x80\x9coff-the-cuff\xe2\x80\x9d tweets, in which he questioned Unsworth\xe2\x80\x99s role in the cave rescue and called him a \xe2\x80\x9cpedo guy,\xe2\x80\x9d with no evidence.\nUnsworth has testified the tweets harmed his reputation by branding him a pedophile and a liar, leaving him \xe2\x80\x9chumiliated, ashamed, dirtied.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHe seeks unspecified damages from Musk, who told the court this week his net worth is around $20 billion.\nThe trial has revived discussion of Musk\xe2\x80\x99s erratic behavior during 2018, when he used Twitter to float a leveraged buyout proposal for Tesla that was scuttled, ultimately paying $20 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission complaint.\nFor most of 2019, Musk, who has nearly 30 million Twitter followers, has largely kept his public comments focused on Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s new models and improved profitability and on the technical progress of his aerospace company, SpaceX.\nTo win the case, Unsworth must prove Musk was negligent in publishing a falsehood that clearly identified him and caused him harm. He does not need to show Musk acted with \xe2\x80\x9cactual malice,\xe2\x80\x9d which is much tougher to prove.\nAdditional reporting by Steve Gorman and Dan Whitcomb; Writing by Dan Whitcomb; Editing by Edwina Gibbs\n'
