REUTERS/Leonhard Foeger\nThe group of more than 20 producers agreed to an extra 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) in cuts for the first quarter of 2020, sources told Reuters, taking the total to 1.7 million bpd, or 1.7% of global demand.\nOPEC and allied producers, the so-called OPEC+, pump more than 40% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s oil. They began a closed-door meeting at around 1130 GMT to thrash out how the additional cuts will be distributed.\nOPEC is likely to shoulder approximately 340,000 bpd in fresh cuts and non-OPEC producers an extra 160,000 bpd, one source said on Friday.\nBenchmark Brent oil prices were steady on Friday near $63 per barrel.\n\xe2\x80\x9cDespite the deeper potential cuts, we view most headlines so far as falling short of consensus expectations,\xe2\x80\x9d Goldman Sachs said in a note citing factors including the short duration of the deal.\nOPEC+ will deepen cuts for the first three months of 2020, shorter than the six- or 12-month scenarios some OPEC members wanted.\nRelated Coverage\nOPEC+ agrees to 500,000 bpd additional cut, to meet in March: sources\nThe cuts offset an expected increase from countries that are not part of OPEC+, including top producer the United States.\nOPEC met on Thursday in Vienna, deliberating policy for  more than five hours. The length of the meeting prompted the cancellation of a news conference and a gala dinner for delegates aboard a boat on the Danube.\nEleven of OPEC\xe2\x80\x99s 14 member states are participating in the supply curbs. Iran, Libya and Venezuela are exempt.\nOPEC+ adds Russia and nine others - Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Brunei, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Mexico, Oman, South Sudan and Sudan.\nOne sticking point has been compliance, with Saudi Arabia cutting more than required in order to offset overproduction from Iraq and Nigeria.\n\xe2\x80\x9cA scenario where the Saudis \xe2\x80\x98absorb\xe2\x80\x99 the majority of a 500,000 bpd cut and formalize their target at current output levels would not be impactful to the market - unless Iraq and Nigeria come into compliance with their targets,\xe2\x80\x9d said analysts from Jefferies.\nING bank analysts said the key question was whether the new cuts were real or just a matter of Saudi Arabia formalizing its current over-compliance.\nJournalists take pictures at the beginning of an OPEC and NON-OPEC meeting in Vienna, Austria December 6, 2019.
