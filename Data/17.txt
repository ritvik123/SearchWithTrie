I can feel,\xe2\x80\x9d Son said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are the same animal. We are both a little crazy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of long-time ally Ma.\nMa said Son initially tried to invest $50 million in the e-commerce firm, but that he declined saying it was too large a sum - part of a pattern of offering big cheques to company founders that continued with WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann.\nSon\xe2\x80\x99s comments come weeks after he was forced to bail out office-sharing startup WeWork when Neumann\xe2\x80\x99s level of control over his firm and hard-partying ways chilled investor appetite and crashed plans for an initial public offering (IPO).\nSon last month said he misjudged Neumann\xe2\x80\x99s character, after WeWork - formally The We Company - and other sputtering bets saw his $100 billion Vision Fund report an $8.9 billion second-quarter operating loss.\nThe conversation at Tokyo University between two of Asia\xe2\x80\x99s most prominent tech entrepreneurs comes at a point of divergence in their careers, with 55-year-old Ma retiring as Alibaba\xe2\x80\x99s executive chairman in September and Son pledging to spend his sixth decade at the helm of his investment juggernaut.\nDomestically, SoftBank hopes to drive commercialization of the emerging field of artificial intelligence (AI), announcing on Friday it will spend 20 billion yen ($184 million) over 10 years funding an AI research institute with Tokyo University.\nSon \xe2\x80\x9cprobably has the biggest guts in the world on doing investment,\xe2\x80\x9d Ma told attendees to the conference.\n\xe2\x80\x9cToo much guts, sometimes I lose a lot of money,\xe2\x80\x9d Son responded.\nSlideshow (5 Images)\nWith the highly leveraged SoftBank trying to raise funds for a second mega fund in which it is currently the only investor, its stake in Alibaba is one possible source of funds.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my view I have not achieved anything yet,\xe2\x80\x9d Son said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m still a challenger and everyday I\xe2\x80\x99m still fighting.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThat approach contrasts with Ma, who stepped back from running Alibaba to focus on philanthropy.\nReporting by Sam Nussey; Additional reporting by Makiko Yamazaki; Editing by Christopher Cushing & Kim Coghill\n"
