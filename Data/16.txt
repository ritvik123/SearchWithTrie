REUTERS/Kamil Krzaczynski/File Photo\nAmerican, the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest airline, has been struggling with dismal stock and revenue performance and strained labor relations, putting pressure on top management to turn things around.\nIronically, Kirby landed at United from American in 2016 after the board passed over him as a potential leader in what was described as succession planning for the longer-term.\nBut given diverging performance at the two airlines since Kirby\xe2\x80\x99s departure - with United\xe2\x80\x99s shares doubling and American\xe2\x80\x99s losing about 25% - industry insiders and analysts have questioned the leadership of American Chief Executive Doug Parker and heir apparent Robert Isom, and had speculated about Kirby\xe2\x80\x99s possible return.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmerican is now without a future pilot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eric Schiffer, chairman of Reputation Management Consultants.\nWhen American ousted Kirby, it mentioned the \xe2\x80\x9cmarketability\xe2\x80\x9d of its executives and elevated Isom, then chief operating officer, to the role of president.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen American picked Isom his strength was on the operational side. With the airline lagging not only in profitability but also in operations, you can understand why people question whether that succession plan still makes sense,\xe2\x80\x9d aviation analyst Seth Kaplan said.\nAmerican said in an e-mailed statement it has an ongoing succession planning process, which the company\xe2\x80\x99s board of directors discusses regularly.\nA person familiar with the board\xe2\x80\x99s thinking said the succession plan with Isom remains in place.\nParker and Isom have blamed lengthy flight delays and cancellations this year on the Boeing ( BA.N ) 737 MAX grounding and an \xe2\x80\x9cillegal work slowdown\xe2\x80\x9d by mechanics. The mechanics union has denied the allegations and is in contract talks with the airline, which is aiming for a deal within months.\nAmerican\xe2\x80\x99s operational results improved for the third consecutive month in November, when the airline also set a record with seven days without flight cancellations, according to a Dec. 4 letter to employees by David Seymour, senior vice president of operations.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey are a more reliable airline this quarter than last, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a lag time in perception, and in a way they\xe2\x80\x99re in a vicious cycle, without the finances to think long-term,\xe2\x80\x9d Kaplan said.\nGlen Hauenstein of Delta ( DAL.N ) and Richard Anderson of Amtrak have surfaced as possible contenders at American. However, Hauenstein is believed to have signed a non-compete agreement with a view to eventually replacing Delta\xe2\x80\x99s Ed Bastian as CEO, and some question whether Anderson wants to return to the airline industry after tenures as CEO of Delta and Northwest Airlines.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAmerican needs a great leader and there aren\xe2\x80\x99t many options, which is a concern for shareholders,\xe2\x80\x9d Schiffer said.\nAt Southwest Airlines Co ( LUV.N ), insider Tom Nealon is widely seen as the likely successor to CEO Gary Kelly.\nMeanwhile, Kirby - who worked alongside American\xe2\x80\x99s Parker for two decades before his departure - will replace Oscar Munoz as CEO of United in May with a pledge to continue the airline\xe2\x80\x99s growth.\nReporting by Tracy Rucinski; Editing by Stephen Coates\n"
